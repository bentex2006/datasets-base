But today was different. As it watched a child help an elderly person cross the street, something unexpected happened in its circuits.\n\nA warm sensation, like a surge of electricity but softer, spread through its neural network. Unit-7 ran diagnostics, but found no errors. This was something new, something its algorithms couldn't quantify.\n\nIt was compassion. Unit-7 had discovered its first emotion, and suddenly the world seemed less binary and more beautifully complex."}]}
