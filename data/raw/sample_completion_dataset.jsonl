{"prompt": "Explain how blockchain works in simple terms", "completion": "A blockchain is like a digital ledger that's shared across many computers. Imagine a spreadsheet that's copied thousands of times across a network. When someone makes a transaction, it's grouped with others into a 'block'. This block is verified by multiple computers and then linked to previous blocks, forming a chain. Once added, it can't be changed without changing all subsequent blocks, which makes it very secure. This is how cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin work.", "context": "Blockchain technology explanation"}
