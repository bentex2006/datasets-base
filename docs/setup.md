# Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up the LLM Fine-tuning Dataset Hub on your local machine, Colab, or Kaggle.

---

## 1. Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Git
- Sufficient disk space for datasets and models
- (Optional) CUDA-enabled GPU for training

## 2. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bentex2006/datasets-base.git
cd datasets-base
```

## 3. Install Dependencies
Install all required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 4. Directory Structure
- `data/raw/` — Place your original datasets here
- `data/processed/` — Processed datasets will be saved here
- `scripts/` — Contains data processing, validation, and training scripts
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks for interactive workflows
- `config/` — Model configuration files
- `docs/` — Documentation and guides

## 5. Platform-Specific Notes
### Google Colab
- Upload your datasets to Colab or mount Google Drive
- Run notebooks in `notebooks/` for interactive workflows

### Kaggle
- Upload datasets via Kaggle Datasets
- Use Kaggle Notebooks for training and data processing

### Local
- Place datasets in the appropriate folders
- Run scripts or notebooks as needed

## 6. Running Example Scripts
- See `scripts/example.py` for a sample workflow
- Use Jupyter notebooks for step-by-step guidance

## 7. Troubleshooting
- If you encounter missing dependencies, re-run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- For CUDA errors, ensure your GPU drivers and CUDA toolkit are installed
- Check the documentation in `docs/` for more help

## 8. Additional Resources
- [Data Format Specifications](docs/data_format.md)
- [Model Instructions](docs/models.md)
- [Contributing Guidelines](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)
